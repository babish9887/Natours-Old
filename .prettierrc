Day 63 of #100DaysOfCode Challenge! ðŸš€

Today, I focused on nested routes in my project! ðŸš€ Implemented a seamless flow for reviews, organized my project with handy factory functions, and ensured tight security with authentication and authorization protocols. Also worked on improving read performance by indexing tours.ðŸ’»
